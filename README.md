What this is: This is the website code. This script, or well, note, will give you a description of what each of the files are for.
 - index.html: HTML is the script type used for website design. This is the MOST IMPORTANT FILE. Without it, no file will be displayed. So the website won't work. SO DO NOT DELETE IT.
