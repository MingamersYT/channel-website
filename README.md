# channel-website

What this is: This is the website code. This script, or well, note, will give you a description of what each of the files are for.
 - appsscript.json: "It defines key configuration settings for the project, such as permissions, API access, script properties, and runtime settings. Essentially, it controls how your script behaves and integrates with other Google services and features." - From ChatGPT (But note that the JSON file cannot be editted.)
 - Deployer.gs: This JavaScript file is used to deploy the website. It notifies the computer to create a URL for the HTML file so that it can be accessed in the browser.
 - index.html: HTML is the script type used for website design. This is the MOST IMPORTANT FILE. Without it, no file will be displayed. So the website won't work. SO DO NOT DELETE IT.

How to edit the code:

You can look through the files and see what's there but if you DO NOT fully understand the code or how to write it then DO NOT make any changes.
Use Ctrl + S to save the code or click the save button with the Drive icon at the top.
